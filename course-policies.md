# Course Policies

## Grading

### Deliverables 
There are 9 project deliverables.  Each deliverable will be graded on a pass/fail basis. 
Students will have opportunities to resubmit deliverables **within 2 weeks** of initial feedback. 

### Final project

Students will plan, execute, and present a **comparative** data analysis on a question of your their own choosing, preferably a question from their own research.
Students will answer the same research question using competing methods, such as regression vs random forest or random forest vs neural network.  Students are encouraged to

1.  Choose a research question for which the development of a predictive model makes sense.
1.  Select a dataset that includes predictors of various types (both continuous and categorical).
1.  Incorporate methods discussed in the course. (For example, transformations, splines, missing data methods, bootstrap, etc.)
1.  Address model selection and fit.
1.  Use graphical displays in both the report and the presentation.
    
During the final exam period, students will present their comparative analysis to the class, giving particular emphasis to the stengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Students will be graded on both the clarity with which they explain course concepts and their approach in the data analysis.

Additional details will be provided in early November.

### Final grades

Final grades will be assigned as follows.

| Grade | Requirement |
|---|---|
| A | A on the final project & successful completion of all 9 deliverables |
| B | B on the final project & successful completion of all 9 deliverables |
| C | C on the final project & successful completion of all 9 deliverables |
| F | Otherwise |

## Adjustments

The instructor may alter the course content and grading policies during the semester.

## Collaborative learning

Students are encouraged to study together.  The instructions for each deliverable will indicate if and how students may work together on the deliverable.
Students should not collaborate on the final project.  Students that violate the collaborative-work policy on an deliverable will fail the deliverable in
question and forfeit the opportunity to retake or resubmit.  Students that violate the collaborative-work policy on the final exam will fail the final exam.
Students may be refered to UVA Honor Committee.

Read the abstract and introduction to

>Carré Justin M and McCormick Cheryl M, 2008, In your face: facial metrics predict aggressive behaviour in the laboratory and in varsity and professional hockey players. Proc. R. Soc. B.2752651–2656

In this assignment, you will repeat the analysis performed for study 2 in the paper.  The data is available online, and can be slurped into R with the following command:

```
d1 <- read.csv("https://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/wp-content/data/chapter17/chap17q01FacesAndPenalties.csv")
```

Specifically,

1. Explain the research question.

1. Write the proposed simple regression model.  (There will be three parameters.)

1. Interpret each parameter of the model in the context of the research question.

1. Fit the regression model with both MLE and Bayesian approaches.  Justify your choice of priors.

1. Recreate figure 3 from the paper with the regression overlay and interval band.  (There will be two figures, one for each analysis approach.)

### Submission instructions

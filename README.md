# Machine Learning I

## Overview

This course is intended for individuals with some exposure to multivariable models such as regression, random forest, or neural nets.  In the context of these multivariable models, the course covers:

1. inference vs prediction (vs false dichotomy)
1. variation, heterogeneity, and confounding
1. non-linear relationships between predictors and the outcome
1. interactions between predictors
1. model complexity
1. carrying capacity of data
1. model stability
1. strategies for right-sizing the model complexity
    * regularization (LASSO, ridge, Bayesian)
    * constraints (principle component, monotonicity)
1. discrimination
1. calibration
1. strategies for data challenges
    * missing data
    * overly influential observations
1. common challenges in observational data analysis
    * selection bias
    * survivor selection bias
    * confounding by indication

These topics will be discussed first in the context of linear regression, and then revisited in the context of logistic regression, ordinal regression, proportional hazards regression, random forests, and (time permitting) neural networks.  The course is hands-on; students will be required to fit the models (via both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches) and implement the strategies discussed in the course.
